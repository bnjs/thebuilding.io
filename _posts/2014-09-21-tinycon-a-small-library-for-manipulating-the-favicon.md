<blockquote>Tinycon allows the addition of alert bubbles and changing the favicon image. Tinycon gracefully falls back to a number in title approach for browsers that don't support canvas or dynamic favicons. Alerts in the favicon allow users to pin a tab and easily see if their attention is needed.</blockquote>
