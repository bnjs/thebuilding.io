<blockquote>Bottlenecks explain "standard" congestion: when more people want to use some facility (e.g., bridge, off-ramp) than it can handle at once, cars form a queue (a line). Below, the yellow zone is a bottleneck with a low speed limit, and the queue is represented by red cars slowed down in the green zone. The queue's size depends on the arrival rate (the rate cars enter). High, medium and low rates will, respectively, grow, hold and shrink the queue.

Gridlock occurs when a queue from one bottleneck makes a new bottleneck in another direction, and so on in a vicious cycle. Below, to see gridlock: click the Play button and push the arrival rate past 40. Gridlock starts when a queue blocks a ramp (colored block). Play around with the arrival rate and trip lengths (how many ramps a car travels before it exits).</blockquote>
