<blockquote>Above all else, mindfulness is the value that most contributes to making Asana a great company. When reflecting as a team, we’re drawn again and again to the ways that it manifests positively in our culture — it underlies the honesty and regularity with which we iterate on our processes, the equanimity we bring to our communication, and our ability to proactively shape a culture that is built to last. These, in turn, empower us to make better decisions, run the company more efficiently, and craft an environment that attracts and retains great people.</blockquote>
