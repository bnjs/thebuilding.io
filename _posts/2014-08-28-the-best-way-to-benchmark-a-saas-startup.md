<blockquote>Following this week's post Benchmarking HubSpot's S-1, Josh and Nikos raised an interesting question on Twitter. What are the right ways to benchmark SaaS companies from their early days through IPO? I have always used years-since-founding as the time axis to compare companies, because if I were a founder, that's how I might think about benchmarks. But after their comments I wondered if there were better ones.

Some potential alternatives are: 
1. Using time before/since-IPO for the time axis. 
2. Grouping companies by ACV to compare growth rates 
3. Grouping companies by Revenue at IPO to compare growth rates</blockquote>
