<blockquote>In my opinion, while most of the media focus on this week’s product launch was around iPhone6 or the potential of AppleWatch, the real long term opportunity is in ApplePay. In one fell swoop, I think Apple has now positioned itself to completely disrupt the US (and potentially international) banking infrastructure in the next 10–20 years and make many trillion (yes, trillion) dollars of incremental revenue doing it.</blockquote>
