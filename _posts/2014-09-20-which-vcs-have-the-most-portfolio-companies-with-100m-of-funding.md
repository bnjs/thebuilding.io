<blockquote>While VCs certainly have an obligation to deploy their LPs capital to generate returns, founders also have an obligation to deploy VC money to grow their businesses. Investors are not merely bystanders, they sit on the boards of these companies and are expected to help set their course. With all this in mind, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at which venture capital firms are most complicit in enabling high burn rates, based on the number* of portfolio companies with $100M or more in total funding to date.</blockquote>
