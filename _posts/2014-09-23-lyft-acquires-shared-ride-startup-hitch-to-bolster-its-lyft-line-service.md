<blockquote>Shared rides are becoming all the rage, with new transportation companies all offering their users a way to lower fares while splitting their commute with a stranger. One of the first services to focus on that capability was a startup called Hitch, which launched before Lyft Line, before UberPool and before Sidecar Shared Rides. The Hitch founders today will be joining one-time competitor Lyft in order to boost that companyâ€™s own shared ride offering.</blockquote>
