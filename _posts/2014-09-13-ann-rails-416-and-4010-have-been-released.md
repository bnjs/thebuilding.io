<blockquote>I am happy to announce that Rails 4.1.6 and 4.0.10 have been released. We are planning to produce one more bug fix release in the 4.0 series, targeted for early December. In keeping with our maintenance policy, after the upcoming release of 4.2.0, the 4.0 series will be retired. It will not receive further updates for either bug fixes or security issues. All users are urged to migrate to 4.1 as soon as possible.</blockquote>
