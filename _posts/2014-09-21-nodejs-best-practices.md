<blockquote>Node.js is JavaScript, so everything you already know about JavaScript applies to your Node application as well. The patterns you use to write your front-end client code can be used when writing your server-side application logic. Node does not use any JavaScript language extensions or modifications to accomplish its goal of server side JavaScript. There are, however, patterns used throughout Node and Joyent that are helpful to know and can be useful while designing your application.</blockquote>
