<blockquote>The taxi business has taken a massive hit thanks to the extraordinary rise in ride-sharing services. A new report from the San Francisco Metropolitan Transportation Agency finds that since 2012, the average number of trips per taxi has plunged from 1,424 a month in March 2012 to 504 in July 2014 â€” a 65 percent drop.</blockquote>
